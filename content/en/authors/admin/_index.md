Hi! My name is Jan-Magnus Kister and I finished my B. Sc. in business informatics in January 2021. Currently I am working as an IT Operations Manager at the EWE TEL GmbH. My work there includes software development with js, java and spring, incident management as well as the general administration of our IT infrastructure. Often, I have to do with Docker, AWS, Azure and Git.

Beyond my professional life, I'm interested in the usage of artificial intelligence, especially in regards to data mining and analysis. Furthermore, I just love Open Source and things like Linux and Git. In my freetime, I work on my personal home and selfhosting setup with software I just find on the web. I am totally amazed by how much there is out there and constantly looking into new things. In doing so, I just love it when something on the web is served by my own personal server, and I am regularly cheerless when he just crashed again.
